# Jtable

![Colored Table Example](doc/examples/uptime_view_colored.png)

Jtable helps you render tables from key/value sources like JSON, YAML, and Python dictionaries.
It works as a CLI tool, a Jinja filter (usable in Ansible, Django, Flask, etc.), or a Python module.

## Features
- Render tables from JSON, YAML, or Python objects
- CLI usage, Jinja filter, or Python import
- Conditional coloring and formatting (see screenshot above)
- Advanced selection, filtering, and transformation with query files
- Output formats: plain, JSON, HTML, GitHub, LaTeX, etc.
- Multi-file loading and aggregation
- Integration with Ansible and other Python frameworks
- Inspect and explore nested data structures

## Basic Usage

```yaml
- hostname: host_1
  os: linux
  cost: 5000
  state: alive
  env: qua
- hostname: host_2
  os: linux
  cost: 5000
  state: alive
  env: qua
- hostname: host_3
  os: linux
  state: unreachable
  env: qua
```

```bash
cat host_dataset.yml | jtable
```

Output:
```text
hostname    os       cost  state        env
----------  -----  ------  -----------  -----
host_1      linux    5000  alive        qua
host_2      linux    5000  alive        qua
host_3      linux          unreachable  qua
