<tr><td>ant         </td><td>A hymenopterous insect of the Linnæan genus Formica, which is now made a family of several genera;
an emmet; a pismire. Note: Among ants, as among bees, there are neuter or working ants, besides the
males and females; the former are without wings. Ants live together in swarms, usually raising
hillocks of earth, variously chambered within, where they maintain a perfect system of order, store
their provisions, and nurture their young. There are many species, with diverse habits, as
agricultural ants, carpenter ants, honey ants, foraging ants, amazon ants, etc. The white ants or
Termites belong to the Neuroptera. Ant bird (Zoöl.), one of a very extensive group of South American
birds (Formicariidæ), which live on ants. The family includes many species, some of which are called
ant shrikes, ant thrushes, and ant wrens. -- Ant rice (Bot.), a species of grass (Aristida
oligantha) cultivated by the agricultural ants of Texas for the sake of its seed.

<tr><td>armadillo   </td><td>(a) Any edentate animal if the family Dasypidæ, peculiar to America. The body and head are incased
in an armor composed of small bony plates. The armadillos burrow in the earth, seldom going abroad
except at night. When attacked, they curl up into a ball, presenting the armor on all sides. Their
flesh is good food. There are several species, one of which (the peba) is found as far north as
Texas. See Peba, Poyou, Tatouay. (b) A genus of small isopod Crustacea that can roll themselves into

<tr><td>camel       </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A large ruminant used in Asia and Africa for carrying burdens and for riding. The camel
is remarkable for its ability to go a long time without drinking. Its hoofs are small, and situated
at the extremities of the toes, and the weight of the animal rests on the callous. The dromedary
(Camelus dromedarius) has one bunch on the back, while the Bactrian camel (C. Bactrianus) has two.
The llama, alpaca, and vicuña, of South America, belong to a related genus (Auchenia). 2. (Naut.)  A
watertight structure (as a large box or boxes) used to assist a vessel in passing over a shoal or
bar or in navigating shallow water. By admitting water, the camel or camels may be sunk and attached
beneath or at the sides of a vessel, and when the water is pumped out the vessel is lifted. Camel
bird (Zoöl.), the ostrich. -- Camel locust (Zoöl.), the mantis. -- Camel&#x27;s thorn (Bot.), a low,
leguminous shrub (Alhagi maurorum) of the Arabian desert, from which exudes a sweetish gum, which is
one of the substances called manna.

(Mya arenaria), the quahog or round clam (Venus mercenaria), the sea clam or hen clam (Spisula

to the Tridacna gigas, a huge East Indian bivalve. You shall scarce find any bay or shallow shore,
or cove of sand, where you may not take many clampes, or lobsters, or both, at your pleasure. Capt.

sand. Wood (1634). 2. (Ship Carp.)  Strong pinchers or forceps. 3. pl. (Mech.)  A kind of vise,

<tr><td>crocodile   </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A large reptile of the genus Crocodilus, of several species. They grow to the length of
sixteen or eighteen feet, and inhabit the large rivers of Africa, Asia, and America. The eggs, laid
in the sand, are hatched by the sun&#x27;s heat. The best known species is that of the Nile (C. vulgaris,
or C. Niloticus). The Florida crocodile (C. Americanus) is much less common than the alligator and
has longer jaws. The name is also sometimes applied to the species of other related genera, as the
gavial and the alligator. 2. (Logic)  A fallacious dilemma, mythically supposed to have been first
used by a crocodile. Crocodile bird (Zoöl.), an African plover (Pluvianus ægypticus) which alights
upon the crocodile and devours its insect parasites, even entering its open mouth (according to
reliable writers) in pursuit of files, etc.; -- called also Nile bird. It is the trochilos of
ancient writers. -- Crocodile tears, false or affected tears; hypocritical sorrow; -- derived from
the fiction of old travelers, that crocodiles shed tears over their prey.

The camel, that great deer. Lindisfarne MS. 2. (Zoöl.)  A ruminant of the genus Cervus, of many
species, and of related genera of the family Cervidæ. The males, and in some species the females,
have solid antlers, often much branched, which are shed annually. Their flesh, for which they are
hunted, is called venison. Note: The deer hunted in England is Cervus elaphus, called also stag or
red deer; the fallow deer is C. dama; the common American deer is C. Virginianus; the blacktailed
deer of Western North America is C. Columbianus; and the mule deer of the same region is C.
macrotis. See Axis, Fallow deer, Mule deer, Reindeer. Note: Deer is much used adjectively, or as the
first part of a compound; as, deerkiller, deerslayer, deerslaying, deer hunting, deer stealing,
deerlike, etc. Deer mouse (Zoöl.), the white-footed mouse (Hesperomys leucopus) of America. -- Small
deer, petty game, not worth pursuing; -- used metaphorically. (See citation from Shakespeare under
the first definition, above.) &quot;Minor critics . . . can find leisure for the chase of such small
deer.&quot; G. P.

<tr><td>dotterel    </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A European bird of the Plover family (Eudromias, or Charadrius, morinellus). It is tame
and easily taken, and is popularly believed to imitate the movements of the fowler. In catching of
dotterels we see how the foolish bird playeth the ape in gestures. Bacon. Note: The ringed dotterel
(or ring plover) is Charadrius hiaticula. 2. A silly fellow; a dupe; a gull.

<tr><td>dove        </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A pigeon of the genus Columba and various related genera. The species are numerous.
Note: The domestic dove, including the varieties called fantails, tumblers, carrier pigeons, etc.,
was derived from the rock pigeon (Columba livia) of Europe and Asia; the turtledove of Europe,
celebrated for its sweet, plaintive note, is C. turtur or Turtur vulgaris; the ringdove, the largest
of European species, is C. palumbus; the Carolina dove, or Mourning dove, is Zenaidura macroura; the
sea dove is the little auk (Mergulus alle or Alle alle). See Turtledove, Ground dove, and Rock
pigeon. The dove is a symbol of innocence, gentleness, and affection; also, in art and in the
Scriptures, the typical symbol of the Holy Ghost. 2. A word of endearment for one regarded as pure
and gentle. O my dove, . . . let me hear thy voice. Cant. ii. 14. Dove tick (Zoöl.), a mite (Argas
reflexus) which infests doves and other birds. -- Soiled dove, a prostitute.

<tr><td>giraffe     </td><td>An African ruminant (Camelopardalis giraffa) related to the deers and antelopes, but placed in a
family by itself; the camelopard. It is the tallest of animals, being sometimes twenty feet from the
hoofs to the top of the head. Its neck is very long, and its fore legs are much longer than its hind
legs.

<tr><td>goat        </td><td>A hollow-horned ruminant of the genus Capra, of several species and varieties, esp. the domestic
goat (C. hircus), which is raised for its milk, flesh, and skin. Note: The Cashmere and Angora
varieties of the goat have long, silky hair, used in the manufacture of textile fabrics. The wild or
bezoar goat (Capra ægagrus), of Asia Minor, noted for the bezoar stones found in its stomach, is
supposed to be one of the ancestral species ofthe domestic goat. The Rocky Montain goat (Haplocercus
montanus) is more nearly related to the antelopes. See Mazame. Goat antelope (Zoöl), one of several
species of antelopes, which in some respects resemble a goat, having recurved horns, a stout body,
large hoofs, and a short, flat tail, as the goral, thar, mazame, and chikara. -- Goat fig (Bot.),
the wild fig. -- Goat house. (a) A place for keeping goats. (b) A brothel. [Obs.] -- Goat moth
(Zoöl.), any moth of the genus Cossus, esp. the large European species (C. ligniperda), the larva of
which burrows in oak and willow trees, and requires three years to mature. It exhales an odor like
that of the he-goat. -- Goat weed (Bot.), a scrophulariaceous plant, of the genus Capraria (C.
biflora). -- Goat&#x27;s bane (Bot.), a poisonous plant (Aconitum Lucoctonum), bearing pale yellow
flowers, introduced from Switzerland into England; wolfsbane. -- Goat&#x27;s beard (Bot.), a plant of the
genus Tragopogon; -- so named from the long silky beard of the seeds. One species is the salsify or
oyster plant. -- Goat&#x27;s foot (Bot.), a kind of wood sorrel (Oxalis caprina) growing at the Cape of
Good Hope. -- Goat&#x27;s rue (Bot.), a leguminous plant (Galega officinalis of Europe, or Tephrosia
Virginiana in the United States). -- Goat&#x27;s thorn (Bot.), a thorny leguminous plant (Astragalus
Tragacanthus), found in the Levant. -- Goat&#x27;s wheat (Bot.), the genus Tragopyrum (now referred to

<tr><td>gorilla     </td><td>A large, arboreal, anthropoid ape of West Africa. It is larger than a man, and is remarkable for its
massive skeleton and powerful muscles, which give it enormous strength. In some respects its
anatomy, more than that of any other ape, except the chimpanzee, resembles that of man.

<tr><td>grasshopper </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any jumping, orthopterous insect, of the families Acrididæ and Locustidæ. The species
and genera are very numerous. The former family includes the Western grasshopper or locust
(Caloptenus spretus), noted for the great extent of its ravages in the region beyond the
Mississippi. In the Eastern United States the red-legged (Caloptenus femurrubrum and C. atlanis) are
closely related species, but their ravages are less important. They are closely related to the
migratory locusts of the Old World. See Locust. Note: The meadow or green grasshoppers belong to the
Locustidæ. They have long antennæ, large ovipositors, and stridulating organs at the base of the
wings in the male. The European great green grasshopper (Locusta viridissima) belongs to this
family. The common American green species mostly belong to Xiphidium, Orchelimum, and Conocephalus.

<tr><td>hawk        </td><td>One of numerous species and genera of rapacious birds of the family Falconidæ. They differ from the
true falcons in lacking the prominent tooth and notch of the bill, and in having shorter and less
pointed wings. Many are of large size and grade into the eagles. Some, as the goshawk, were formerly
trained like falcons. In a more general sense the word is not infrequently applied, also, to true
falcons, as the sparrow hawk, pigeon hawk, duck hawk, and prairie hawk. Note: Among the common
American species are the red-tailed hawk (Buteo borealis); the red-shouldered (B. lineatus); the
broad-winged (B. Pennsylvanicus); the rough-legged (Archibuteo lagopus); the sharp-shinned Accipiter
fuscus). See Fishhawk, Goshawk, Marsh hawk, under Marsh, Night hawk, under Night. Bee hawk (Zoöl.),

<tr><td>heron       </td><td>Any wading bird of the genus Ardea and allied genera, of the family Ardeidæ. The herons have a long,
sharp bill, and long legs and toes, with the claw of the middle toe toothed. The common European
heron (Ardea cinerea) is remarkable for its directly ascending flight, and was formerly hunted with
the larger falcons. Note: There are several common American species; as, the great blue heron (Ardea
herodias); the little blue (A. coerulea); the green (A. virescens); the snowy (A. candidissima); the
night heron or qua-bird (Nycticorax nycticorax). The plumed herons are called egrets. Heron&#x27;s bill
(Bot.), a plant of the genus Erodium; -- so called from the fancied resemblance of the fruit to the
head and beak of the heron.

<tr><td>hornet      </td><td>A large, strong wasp. The European species (Vespa crabro) is of a dark brown and yellow color. It is
very pugnacious, and its sting is very severe. Its nest is constructed of a paperlike material, and
the layers of comb are hung together by columns. The American white- faced hornet (V. maculata) is
larger and has similar habits. Hornet fly (Zoöl.), any dipterous insect of the genus Asilus, and

<tr><td>horse       </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A hoofed quadruped of the genus Equus; especially, the domestic horse (E. caballus),
which was domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a very early period. It has six broad molars, on each
side of each jaw, with six incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The mares usually
have the canine teeth rudimentary or wanting. The horse differs from the true asses, in having a
long, flowing mane, and the tail bushy to the base. Unlike the asses it has callosities, or
chestnuts, on all its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed, docility, courage, and nobleness of
character, and is used for drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes. Note: Many
varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait, speed, etc., are known, but all are believed to
have been derived from the same original species. It is supposed to have been a native of the plains
of Central Asia, but the wild species from which it was derived is not certainly known. The feral
horses of America are domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably true that most of those
of Asia have a similar origin. Some of the true wild Asiatic horses do, however, approach the
domestic horse in several characteristics. Several species of fossil (Equus) are known from the
later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The fossil species of other genera of the family
Equidæ are also often called horses, in general sense. 2. The male of the genus horse, in
distinction from the female or male; usually, a castrated male. 3. Mounted soldiery; cavalry; --

<tr><td>ibis        </td><td>Any bird of the genus Ibis and several allied genera, of the family Ibidæ, inhabiting both the Old
World and the New. Numerous species are known. They are large, wading birds, having a long, curved
beak, and feed largely on reptiles. Note: The sacred ibis of the ancient Egyptians (Ibis Æthiopica)
has the head and neck black, without feathers. The plumage of the body and wings is white, except
the tertiaries, which are lengthened and form a dark purple plume. In ancient times this bird was
extensively domesticated in Egypt, but it is now seldom seen so far north. The glossy ibis (Plegadis
autumnalis), which is widely distributed both in the Old World and the New, has the head and neck
feathered, except between the eyes and bill; the scarlet ibis (Guara rubra) and the white ibis (G.
alba) inhabit the West Indies and South America, and are rarely found in the United States. The wood
ibis (Tantalus loculator) of America belongs to the Stork family (Ciconidæ).

<tr><td>jackal      </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of carnivorous animals inhabiting Africa and Asia, related to
the dog and wolf. They are cowardly, nocturnal, and gregarious. They feed largely on carrion, and
are noted for their piercing and dismal howling. Note: The common species of Southern Asia (Canis
aureus) is yellowish gray, varied with brown on the shoulders, haunches, and legs. The common
African species (C. anthus) is darker in color. 2. One who does mean work for another&#x27;s advantage,
as jackals were once thought to kill game which lions appropriated. [Colloq.] Ld.

<tr><td>kingfisher  </td><td>Any one of numerous species of birds constituting the family Alcedinidæ. Most of them feed upon
fishes which they capture by diving and seizing then with the beak; others feed only upon reptiles,
insects, etc. About one hundred and fifty species are known. They are found in nearly all parts of
the world, but are particularly abundant in the East Indies. Note: The belted king-fisher of the
United States (Ceryle alcyon) feeds upon fishes. It is slate-blue above, with a white belly and
breast, and a broad white ring around the neck. A dark band crosses the breast. The common European
species (Alcedo ispida), which is much smaller and brighter colored, is also a fisher. See Alcedo.
The wood kingfishers (Halcyones), which inhabit forests, especially in Africa, feed largely upon
insects, but also eat reptiles, snails, and small Crustacea, as well as fishes. The giant kingfisher
of Australia feeds largely upon lizards and insects.

<tr><td>lark        </td><td>Any one numerous species of singing birds of the genus Alauda and allied genera (family Alaudidæ).
They mostly belong to Europe, Asia, and Northern Africa. In America they are represented by the
shore larks, or horned by the shore larks, or horned larks, of the genus Otocoris. The true larks
have holaspidean tarsi, very long hind claws, and usually, dull, sandy brown colors. Note: The
European skylark, or lark of the poets (Alauda arvensis), is of a brown mottled color, and is noted
for its clear and sweet song, uttered as it rises and descends almost perpendicularly in the air. It
is considered a table delicacy, and immense numbers are killed for the markets. Other well-known
European species are the crested, or tufted, lark (Alauda cristata), and the wood lark (A. arborea).
The pipits, or titlarks, of the genus Anthus (family Motacillidæ) are often called larks. See Pipit.
The American meadow larks, of the genus Sturnella, are allied to the starlings. See Meadow Lark. The
Australian bush lark is Mirafra Horsfieldii. See Shore lark. Lark bunting (Zoöl.), a fringilline

<tr><td>lion        </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A large carnivorous feline mammal (Felis leo), found in Southern Asia and in most parts
of Africa, distinct varieties occurring in the different countries. The adult male, in most
varieties, has a thick mane of long shaggy hair that adds to his apparent size, which is less than
that of the largest tigers. The length, however, is sometimes eleven feet to the base of the tail.
The color is a tawny yellow or yellowish brown; the mane is darker, and the terminal tuft of the
tail is black. In one variety, called the maneless lion, the male has only a slight mane. 2.
(Astron.)  A sign and a constellation; Leo. 3. An object of interest and curiosity, especially a
person who is so regarded; as, he was quite a lion in London at that time. Such society was far more
enjoyable than that of Edinburgh, for here he was not a lion, but a man. Prof. Wilson. American lion
(Zoöl.), the puma or cougar. -- Lion ant (Zoöl.), the ant-lion. -- Lion dog (Zoöl.), a fancy dog
with a flowing mane, usually clipped to resemble a lion&#x27;s mane. -- Lion lizard (Zoöl.), the
basilisk. -- Lion&#x27;s share, all, or nearly all; the best or largest part; -- from Æsop&#x27;s fable of the
lion hunting in company with certain smaller beasts, and appropriating to himself all the prey.

lobster (H. Americanus), and the European lobster (H. vulgaris). The Norwegian lobster (Nephrops
Norvegicus) is similar in form. All these have a pair of large unequal claws. The spiny lobsters of
more southern waters, belonging to Palinurus, Panulirus, and allied genera, have no large claws. The
fresh-water crayfishes are sometimes called lobsters. Lobster caterpillar (Zoöl.), the caterpillar
of a European bombycid moth (Stauropus fagi); -- so called from its form. Lobster louse (Zoöl.), a
copepod crustacean (Nicothoë astaci) parasitic on the gills of the European lobster.

<tr><td>locust      </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of long-winged, migratory, orthopterous insects, of the
family Acrididæ, allied to the grasshoppers; esp., (Edipoda, or Pachytylus, migratoria, and Acridium
perigrinum, of Southern Europe, Asia, and Africa. In the United States the related species with
similar habits are usually called grasshoppers. See Grasshopper. Note: These insects are at times so
numerous in Africa and the south of Asia as to devour every green thing; and when they migrate, they
fly in an immense cloud. In the United States the harvest flies are improperly called locusts. See
Cicada. Locust beetle (Zoöl.), a longicorn beetle (Cyllene robiniæ), which, in the larval state,
bores holes in the wood of the locust tree. Its color is brownish black, barred with yellow. Called
also locust borer. -- Locust bird (Zoöl.) the rose-colored starling or pastor of India. See Pastor.

<tr><td>manatee     </td><td>Any species of Trichechus, a genus of sirenians; -- called alsosea cow. [Written also manaty,
manati.] Note: One species (Trichechus Senegalensis) inhabits the west coast of Africa; another (T.
Americanus) inhabits the east coast of South America, and the West-Indies. The Florida manatee (T.
latirostris) is by some considered a distinct species, by others it is thought to be a variety of T.
Americanus. It sometimes becomes fifteen feet or more in length, and lives both in fresh and salt
water. It is hunted for its oil and flesh.

<tr><td>mole        </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any insectivore of the family Talpidæ. They have minute eyes and ears, soft fur, and
very large and strong fore feet. Note: The common European mole, or moldwarp (Talpa Europæa), is
noted for its extensive burrows. The common American mole, or shrew mole (Scalops aquaticus), and
star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) have similar habits. Note: In the Scriptures, the name is
applied to two unindentified animals, perhaps the chameleon and mole rat. 2. A plow of peculiar
construction, for forming underground drains. [U.S.] Duck mole. See under Duck. -- Golden mole. See
Chrysochlore. -- Mole cricket (Zoöl.), an orthopterous insect of the genus Gryllotalpa, which
excavates subterranean galleries, and throws up mounds of earth resembling those of the mole. It is
said to do damage by injuring the roots of plants. The common European species (Gryllotalpa
vulgaris), and the American (G. borealis), are the best known. -- Mole rat (Zoöl.), any one of
several species of Old World rodents of the genera Spalax, Georychus, and several allied genera.
They are molelike in appearance and habits, and their eyes are small or rudimentary. -- Mole shrew

<tr><td>mosquito    </td><td>Any one of various species of gnats of the genus Culex and allied genera. The females have a
proboscis containing, within the sheathlike labium, six fine, sharp, needlelike organs with which
they puncture the skin of man and animals to suck the blood. These bites, when numerous, cause, in
many persons, considerable irritation and swelling, with some pain. The larvæ and pupæ, called
wigglers, are aquatic. [Written also musquito.] Mosquito bar, Mosquito net, a net or curtain for

<tr><td>okapi       </td><td>A peculiar mammal (Okapia johnostoni) closely related to the giraffe, discovered in the deep forests
of Belgian Kongo in 1900. It is smaller than an ox, and somewhat like a giraffe, except that the
neck is much shorter. Like the giraffe, it has no dewclaws. There is a small prominence on each
frontal bone of the male. The color of the body is chiefly reddish chestnut, the cheeks are
yellowish white, and the fore and hind legs above the knees and the haunches are striped with
purplish black and cream color.

<tr><td>ostrich     </td><td>A large bird of the genus Struthio, of which Struthio camelus of Africa is the best known species.
It has long and very strong legs, adapted for rapid running; only two toes; a long neck, nearly bare
of feathers; and short wings incapable of flight. The adult male is about eight feet high. Note: The
South African ostrich (Struthio australis) and the Asiatic ostrich are considered distinct species
by some authors. Ostriches are now domesticated in South Africa in large numbers for the sake of
their plumes. The body of the male is covered with elegant black plumose feathers, while the wings
and tail furnish the most valuable white plumes. Ostrich farm, a farm on which ostriches are bred

brown species (P. fuscus) are abundant on the Florida coast in winter, but breed about the lakes in
the Rocky Mountains and British America. 2. (Old Chem.)  A retort or still having a curved tube or

<tr><td>penguin     </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any bird of the order Impennes, or Ptilopteri. They are covered with short, thick
feathers, almost scalelike on the wings, which are without true quills. They are unable to fly, but
use their wings to aid in diving, in which they are very expert. See King penguin, under Jackass.
Note: Penguins are found in the south temperate and antarctic regions. The king penguins
(Aptenodytes Patachonica, and A. longirostris) are the largest; the jackass penguins (Spheniscus)
and the rock hoppers (Catarractes) congregate in large numbers at their breeding grounds. 2. (Bot.)

<tr><td>rail        </td><td>Any one of numerous species of limicoline birds of the family Rallidæ, especially those of the genus
Rallus, and of closely allied genera. They are prized as game birds. Note: The common European water
rail (Rallus aquaticus) is called also bilcock, skitty coot, and brook runner. The best known
American species are the clapper rail, or salt-marsh hen (Rallus lonqirostris, var. crepitans); the
king, or red-breasted, rail (R. elegans) (called also fresh-water marshhen); the lesser clapper, or
Virginia, rail (R. Virginianus); and the Carolina, or sora, rail (Porzana Carolina). See Sora. Land

after the accession of the house of Hanover, some of the brown, that is the German or Norway, rats,
were first brought over to this country (in some timber as is said); and being much stronger than
the black, or, till then, the common, rats, they in many places quite extirpated the latter. The
word (both the noun and the verb to rat) was first, as we have seen, leveled at the converts to the
government of George the First, but has by degrees obtained a wide meaning, and come to be applied
to any sudden and mercenary change in politics.&quot; Lord Mahon. Bamboo rat (Zoöl.), any Indian rodent

<tr><td>rhinoceros  </td><td>Any pachyderm belonging to the genera Rhinoceros, Atelodus, and several allied genera of the family
Rhinocerotidæ, of which several living, and many extinct, species are known. They are large and
powerful, and usually have either one or two stout conical median horns on the snout. Note: The
Indian, or white, and the Javan rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros Indicus and R. Sondaicus) have incisor and
canine teeth, but only one horn, and the very thick skin forms shieldlike folds. The two or three
African species belong to Atelodus, and have two horns, but lack the dermal folds, and the incisor
and canine teeth. The two Malay, or East Indian, two-horned species belong to Ceratohinus, in which
incisor and canine teeth are present. See Borele, and Keitloa. Rhinoceros auk (Zoöl.), an auk of the
North Pacific (Cerorhina monocrata) which has a deciduous horn on top of the bill. -- Rhinoceros
beetle (Zoöl.), a very large beetle of the genus Dynastes, having a horn on the head. -- Rhinoceros
bird. (Zoöl.) (a) A large hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros), native of the East Indies. It has a large
hollow hornlike process on the bill. Called also rhinoceros hornbill. See Hornbill. (b) An African
beefeater (Buphaga Africana). It alights on the back of the rhinoceros in search of parasitic
insects.

<tr><td>rook        </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  A European bird (Corvus frugilegus) resembling the crow, but smaller. It is black, with
purple and violet reflections. The base of the beak and the region around it are covered with a
rough, scabrous skin, which in old birds is whitish. It is gregarious in its habits. The name is
also applied to related Asiatic species. The rook . . . should be treated as the farmer&#x27;s friend.

<tr><td>salamander  </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of Urodela, belonging to Salamandra, Amblystoma, Plethodon,
and various allied genera, especially those that are more or less terrestrial in their habits. Note:
The salamanders have, like lizards, an elongated body, four feet, and a long tail, but are destitute
of scales. They are true Amphibia, related to the frogs. Formerly, it was a superstition that the
salamander could live in fire without harm, and even extinguish it by the natural coldness of its
body. I have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years. Shak.

<tr><td>salmon      </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of fishes of the genus Salmo and allied genera. The common
salmon (Salmo salar) of Northern Europe and Eastern North America, and the California salmon, or
quinnat, are the most important species. They are extensively preserved for food. See Quinnat. Note:
The salmons ascend rivers and penetrate to their head streams to spawn. They are remarkably strong
fishes, and will even leap over considerable falls which lie in the way of their progress. The
common salmon has been known to grow to the weight of seventy-five pounds; more generally it is from
fifteen to twenty-five pounds. Young salmon are called parr, peal, smolt, and grilse. Among the true
salmons are: Black salmon, or Lake salmon, the namaycush. -- Dog salmon, a salmon of Western North
America (Oncorhynchus keta). -- Humpbacked salmon, a Pacific-coast salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha).
-- King salmon, the quinnat. -- Landlocked salmon, a variety of the common salmon (var. Sebago),
long confined in certain lakes in consequence of obstructions that prevented it from returning to
the sea. This last is called also dwarf salmon. Among fishes of other families which are locally and
erroneously called salmon are: the pike perch, called jack salmon; the spotted, or southern,
squeteague; the cabrilla, called kelp salmon; young pollock, called sea salmon; and the California
yellowtail. 2. A reddish yellow or orange color, like the flesh of the salmon. Salmon berry (Bot.),
a large red raspberry growing from Alaska to California, the fruit of the Rubus Nutkanus. -- Salmon
killer (Zoöl.), a stickleback (Gasterosteus cataphractus) of Western North America and Northern
Asia. -- Salmon ladder, salmon stair. See Fish ladder, under Fish. -- Salmon peel, a young salmon.
-- Salmon pipe, a certain device for catching salmon. Crabb. -- Salmon trout. (Zoöl.) (a) The
European sea trout (Salmo trutta). It resembles the salmon, but is smaller, and has smaller and more

<tr><td>sardine     </td><td>Any one of several small species of herring which are commonly preserved in olive oil for food,
especially the pilchard, or European sardine (Clupea pichardus). The California sardine (Clupea
sagax) is similar. The American sardines of the Atlantic coast are mostly the young of the common
herring and of the menhaden.

suctorial mouth, large claw-bearing palpi, and a caudal sting. Note: Scorpions have a flattened
body, and a long, slender post- abdomen formed of six movable segments, the last of which terminates
in a curved venomous sting. The venom causes great pain, but is unattended either with redness or
swelling, except in the axillary or inguinal glands, when an extremity is affected. It is seldom if
ever destructive of life. Scorpions are found widely dispersed in the warm climates of both the Old
and New Worlds. 2. (Zoöl.)  The pine or gray lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). [Local, U.S.] 3. (Zoöl.)

<tr><td>shark       </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of elasmobranch fishes of the order Plagiostomi, found in
all seas. Note: Some sharks, as the basking shark and the whale shark, grow to an enormous size, the
former becoming forty feet or more, and the latter sixty feet or more, in length. Most of them are
harmless to man, but some are exceedingly voracious. The man-eating sharks mostly belong to the
genera Carcharhinus, Carcharodon, and related genera. They have several rows of large sharp teeth
with serrated edges, as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias, or Rondeleti) of tropical
seas, and the great blue shark (Carcharhinus glaucus) of all tropical and temperate seas. The former
sometimes becomes thirty-six feet long, and is the most voracious and dangerous species known. The
rare man-eating shark of the United States coast (Charcarodon Atwoodi) is thought by some to be a
variety, or the young, of C. carcharias. The dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), and the smaller
blue shark (C. caudatus), both common species on the coast of the United States, are of moderate
size and not dangerous. They feed on shellfish and bottom fishes. 2. A rapacious, artful person; a
sharper. [Colloq.] 3. Trickery; fraud; petty rapine; as, to live upon the shark. [Obs.] South.

<tr><td>sheep       </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of ruminants of the genus Ovis, native of the higher
mountains of both hemispheres, but most numerous in Asia. Note: The domestic sheep (Ovis aries)
varies much in size, in the length and texture of its wool, the form and size of its horns, the
length of its tail, etc. It was domesticated in prehistoric ages, and many distinct breeds have been
produced; as the merinos, celebrated for their fine wool; the Cretan sheep, noted for their long
horns; the fat-tailed, or Turkish, sheep, remarkable for the size and fatness of the tail, which
often has to be supported on trucks; the Southdowns, in which the horns are lacking; and an Asiatic
breed which always has four horns. 2. A weak, bashful, silly fellow. Ainsworth. 3. pl.  Fig.: The

<tr><td>skunk       </td><td>Any one of several species of American musteline carnivores of the genus Mephitis and allied genera.
They have two glands near the anus, secreting an extremely fetid liquid, which the animal ejects at
pleasure as a means of defense. Note: The common species of the Eastern United States (Mephitis
mephitica) is black with more or less white on the body and tail. The spotted skunk (Spilogale
putorius), native of the Southwestern United States and Mexico, is smaller than the common skunk,
and is variously marked with black and white. Skunk bird, Skunk blackbird (Zoöl.), the bobolink; --
so called because the male, in the breeding season, is black and white, like a skunk. -- Skunk

<tr><td>spider      </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of arachnids comprising the order Araneina. Spiders have the
mandibles converted into poison fangs, or falcers. The abdomen is large and not segmented, with two
or three pairs of spinnerets near the end, by means of which they spin threads of silk to form
cocoons, or nests, to protect their eggs and young. Many species spin also complex webs to entrap
the insects upon which they prey. The eyes are usually eight in number (rarely six), and are
situated on the back of the cephalothorax. See Illust. under Araneina. Note: Spiders are divided
into two principal groups: the Dipneumona, having two lungs: and the Tetrapneumona, having four
lungs. See Mygale. The former group includes several tribes; as, the jumping spiders (see
Saltigradæ), the wolf spiders, or Citigradæ (see under Wolf), the crab spiders, or Laterigradæ (see
under Crab), the garden, or geometric, spiders, or Orbitellæ (see under Geometrical, and Garden),
and others. See Bird spider, under Bird, Grass spider, under Grass, House spider, under House, Silk
spider, under Silk. 2. (Zoöl.)  Any one of various other arachnids resembling the true spiders,
especially certain mites, as the red spider (see under Red). 3. An iron pan with a long handle, used
as a kitchen utensil in frying food. Originally, it had long legs, and was used over coals on the
hearth. 4. A trevet to support pans or pots over a fire. 5. (Mach.)  A skeleton, or frame, having
radiating arms or members, often connected by crosspieces; as, a casting forming the hub and spokes
to which the rim of a fly wheel or large gear is bolted; the body of a piston head; a frame for
strengthening a core or mold for a casting, etc. Spider ant. (Zoöl.) Same as Solitary ant, under
Solitary. -- Spider crab (Zoöl.), any one of numerous species of maioid crabs having a more or less
triangular body and ten long legs. Some of the species grow to great size, as the great Japanese
spider crab (Macrocheira Kempferi), measuring sometimes more than fifteen feet across the legs when
they are extended. -- Spider fly (Zoöl.), any one of numerous species of parasitic dipterous insects
of the family Hippoboscidæ. They are mostly destitute of wings, and live among the feathers of birds
and the hair of bats. Called also bird tick, and bat tick. -- Spider hunter (Zoöl.), any one of
several species of East Indian sunbirds of the genus Arachnothera. -- Spider lines, filaments of a
spider&#x27;s web crossing the field of vision in optical instruments; -- used for determining the exact
position of objects and making delicate measurements. Fine wires, silk fibers, or lines on glass
similarly placed, are called spider lines. -- Spider mite. (Zoöl.) (a) Any one of several species of
parasitic mites of the genus Argas and allied genera. See Argas. (b) Any one of numerous small mites
injurious to plants. -- Spider monkey (Zoöl.), any one of numerous species of South American monkeys
of the genus Ateles, having very long legs and a long prehensile tail. -- Spider orchis (Bot.), a
European orchidaceous plant (Ophrys aranifera), having flowers which resemble spiders. -- Spider
shell (Zoöl.), any shell of the genus Pteroceras.

variable in color, the southern variety being frequently black, while the northern and western
varieties are usually gray or rusty brown; the red squirrel (see Chickaree); the striped, or
chipping, squirrel (see Chipmunk); and the California gray squirrel (S. fossor). Several other
species inhabit Mexico and Central America. The common European species (Sciurus vulgaris) has a
long tuft of hair on each ear. the so-called Australian squirrels are marsupials. See Petaurist, and

<tr><td>swan        </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of large aquatic birds belonging to Cygnus, Olor, and allied
genera of the subfamily Cygninæ. They have a large and strong beak and a long neck, and are noted
for their graceful movements when swimming. Most of the northern species are white. In literature
the swan was fabled to sing a melodious song, especially at the time of its death. Note: The
European white, or mute, swan (Cygnus gibbus), which is most commonly domesticated, bends its neck
in an S-shaped curve. The whistling, or trumpeting, swans of the genus Olor do not bend the neck in
an S-shaped curve, and are noted for their loud and sonorous cry, due to complex convolutions of the
windpipe. To this genus belong the European whooper, or whistling swan (Olor cygnus), the American
whistling swan (O. Columbianus), and the trumpeter swan (O. buccinator). The Australian black swan
(Chenopis atrata) is dull black with white on the wings, and has the bill carmine, crossed with a
white band. It is a very graceful species and is often domesticated. The South American black-necked
swan (Sthenelides melancorypha) is a very beautiful and graceful species, entirely white, except the
head and neck, which are dark velvety seal-brown. Its bill has a double bright rose-colored knob. 2.

<tr><td>tapir       </td><td>Any one of several species of large odd-toed ungulates belonging to Tapirus, Elasmognathus, and
allied genera. They have a long prehensile upper lip, short ears, short and stout legs, a short,
thick tail, and short, close hair. They have three toes on the hind feet, and four toes on the fore
feet, but the outermost toe is of little use. Note: The best-known species are the Indian tapir
(Tapirus Indicus), native of the East Indies and Malacca, which is black with a broad band of white
around the middle, and the common American tapir (T. Americanus), which, when adult, is dull brown.
Several others species inhabit the Andes and Central America.

<tr><td>toad        </td><td>Any one of numerous species of batrachians belonging to the genus Bufo and allied genera, especially
those of the family Bufonidæ. Toads are generally terrestrial in their habits except during the
breeding season, when they seek the water. Most of the species burrow beneath the earth in the
daytime and come forth to feed on insects at night. Most toads have a rough, warty skin in which are
glands that secrete an acrid fluid. Note: The common toad (Bufo vulgaris) and the natterjack are
familiar European species. The common American toad (B. lentiginosus) is similar to the European
toad, but is less warty and is more active, moving chiefly by leaping. Obstetrical toad. (Zoöl.) See

<tr><td>trout       </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of fishes belonging to Salmo, Salvelinus, and allied genera
of the family Salmonidæ. They are highly esteemed as game fishes and for the quality of their flesh.
All the species breed in fresh water, but after spawning many of them descend to the sea if they
have an opportunity. Note: The most important European species are the river, or brown, trout (Salmo
fario), the salmon trout, and the sewen. The most important American species are the brook,
speckled, or red-spotted, trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) of the Northern United States and Canada;
the red-spotted trout, or Dolly Varden (see Malma); the lake trout (see Namaycush); the black-
spotted, mountain, or silver, trout (Salmo purpuratus); the golden, or rainbow, trout (see under
Rainbow); the blueback trout (see Oquassa); and the salmon trout (see under Salmon.) The European
trout has been introduced into America. 2. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of marine fishes more
or less resembling a trout in appearance or habits, but not belonging to the same family, especially
the California rock trouts, the common squeteague, and the southern, or spotted, squeteague; --
called also salt-water trout, sea trout, shad trout, and gray trout. See Squeteague, and Rock trout
under Rock. Trout perch (Zoöl.), a small fresh-water American fish (Percopsis guttatus), allied to
the trout, but resembling a perch in its scales and mouth.

Chelonia, having usually a smooth greenish or olive-colored shell. It is highly valued for the
delicacy of its flesh, which is used especially for turtle soup. Two distinct species or varieties
are known; one of which (Chelonia Midas) inhabits the warm part of the Atlantic Ocean, and sometimes
weighs eight hundred pounds or more; the other (C. virgata) inhabits the Pacific Ocean. Both species
are similar in habits and feed principally on seaweed and other marine plants, especially the turtle
grass. -- Turtle cowrie (Zoöl.), a large, handsome cowrie (Cypræa testudinaria); the turtle-shell;
so called because of its fancied resemblance to a tortoise in color and form. -- Turtle grass

<tr><td>vulture     </td><td>Any one of numerous species of rapacious birds belonging to Vultur, Cathartes, Catharista, and
various other genera of the family Vulturidæ. Note: In most of the species the head and neck are
naked or nearly so. They feed chiefly on carrion. The condor, king vulture, turkey buzzard, and
black vulture (Catharista atrata) are well known American species. The griffin, lammergeir, and
Pharaoh&#x27;s chicken, or Egyptian vulture, are common Old World vultures.

<tr><td>walrus      </td><td>A very large marine mammal (Trichecus rosmarus) of the Seal family, native of the Arctic Ocean. The
male has long and powerful tusks descending from the upper jaw. It uses these in procuring food and
in fighting. It is hunted for its oil, ivory, and skin. It feeds largely on mollusks. Called also
morse. Note: The walrus of the North Pacific and Behring Strait (Trichecus obesus) is regarded by
some as a distinct species, by others as a variety of the common walrus.

<tr><td>whale       </td><td>Any aquatic mammal of the order Cetacea, especially any one of the large species, some of which
become nearly one hundred feet long. Whales are hunted chiefly for their oil and baleen, or
whalebone. Note: The existing whales are divided into two groups: the toothed whales (Odontocete),
including those that have teeth, as the cachalot, or sperm whale (see Sperm whale); and the baleen,
or whalebone, whales (Mysticete), comprising those that are destitute of teeth, but have plates of
baleen hanging from the upper jaw, as the right whales. The most important species of whalebone

<tr><td>woodcock    </td><td>1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of long-billed limicoline birds belonging to the genera
Scolopax and Philohela. They are mostly nocturnal in their habits, and are highly esteemed as game

<tr><td>woodpecker  </td><td>Any one of numerous species of scansorial birds belonging to Picus and many allied genera of the
family Picidæ. Note: These birds have the tail feathers pointed and rigid at the tip to aid in
climbing, and a strong chisellike bill with which they are able to drill holes in the bark and wood
of trees in search of insect larvæ upon which most of the species feed. A few species feed partly
upon the sap of trees (see Sap sucker, under Sap), others spend a portion of their time on the
ground in search of ants and other insects. The most common European species are the greater spotted
woodpecker (Dendrocopus major), the lesser spotted woodpecker (D. minor), and the green woodpecker,
or yaffle (see Yaffle). The best- known American species are the pileated woodpecker (see under
Pileated), the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), which is one of the largest known
species, the red-headed woodpecker, or red-head (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), the red-bellied
woodpecker (M. Carolinus) (see Chab), the superciliary woodpecker (M. superciliaris), the hairy
woodpecker (Dryobates villosus), the downy woodpecker (D. pubescens), the three-toed, woodpecker
(Picoides Americanus), the golden-winged woodpecker (see Flicker), and the sap suckers. See also
Carpintero. Woodpecker hornbill (Zoöl.), a black and white Asiatic hornbill (Buceros pica) which
resembles a woodpecker in color.

<tr><td>zebra       </td><td>Either one of two species of South African wild horses remarkable for having the body white or
yellowish white, and conspicuously marked with dark brown or brackish bands. Note: The true or
mountain zebra (Equus, or Asinus, zebra) is nearly white, and the bands which cover the body and
legs are glossy black. Its tail has a tuft of black hair at the tip. It inhabits the mountains of
Central and Southern Africa, and is noted for its wariness and wildness, as well as for its
swiftness. The second species (Equus, or Asinus, Burchellii), known as Burchell&#x27;s zebra, and dauw,
inhabits the grassy plains of South Africa, and differs from the preceding in not having dark bands
on the legs, while those on the body are more irregular. It has a long tail, covered with long white
flowing hair. Zebra caterpillar, the larva of an American noctuid moth (Mamestra picta). It is light
yellow, with a broad black stripe on the back and one on each side; the lateral stripes are crossed
with withe lines. It feeds on cabbages, beets, clover, and other cultivated plants. -- Zebra
opossum, the zebra wolf. See under Wolf. -- Zebra parrakeet, an Australian grass parrakeet, often
kept as a cage bird. Its upper parts are mostly pale greenish yellow, transversely barred with
brownish black crescents; the under parts, rump, and upper tail coverts, are bright green; two
central tail feathers and the cheek patches are blue. Called also canary parrot, scallop parrot,
shell parrot, and undulated parrot. -- Zebra poison (Bot.), a poisonous tree (Euphorbia arborea) of
the Spurge family, found in South Africa. Its milky juice is so poisonous that zebras have been
killed by drinking water in which its branches had been placed, and it is also used as an arrow
poison. J. Smith (Dict. Econ. Plants). -- Zebra shark. Same as Tiger shark, under Tiger. -- Zebra
spider, a hunting spider. -- Zebra swallowtail, a very large North American swallow-tailed butterfly
